# JS-Snippets - dom
Shows how to manipulate DOM elements.

## Scenario
You need a feature to manipulate the DOM elements with JavaScript.

## Learning
- Dynamically create and remove elements, change styles and attributes.
- Add and remove event listeners.

## Exercise
Make a web page that 
- Changes the body background to a random color (see the snippet code hex color randomizer)
    - When the page is loaded it should wait 5 seconds before triggering interval based color changes (using setTimeout(...) function).
    -  After the 5 second wait, after the page load, the color should change every second (using setInterval function).
